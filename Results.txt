## AdamW Performance Improvement

AdamW optimizes the accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, which are all higher compared to the SGD optimizer. In particular, AdamW gives an accuracy of 83% and an F1 score of 0.83, which is really good compared to SGD's 30% accuracy and 0.18 F1 score. This shows that AdamW does a better job in predicting correctly and balances the rate of false positives against false negatives.

The figures have probably meant to show the smoother, more consistent reduction in loss and steady improvement in accuracy of AdamW over epochs rather than the erratic patterns presented with SGD. The other more ideal attribute of AdamW for this complex dataset is the adaptive learning rate mechanism of AdamW in adjusting the updates based on parameter frequency, resulting in quicker convergence and better generalization on the test set. Thus, AdamW is chosen for its reliable performance and efficiency in learning, particularly in complex model setups where SGD may fail without much tuning.

## ResNet-18 Performance Improvement

The other two optimization algorithms, AdamW and SGD, do much worse in comparison to the pretrained ResNet model. The ResNet model gives excellent scores in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score: 93%, 93.14% precision, 93% recall, and 92.98% F1 score. The results from AdamW were very good: an accuracy of 83% and an F1 score of 82.91%; thus, the ResNet improved the results by about 10% in both cases. The performance metrics for SGD indicate that they are very low: 30% in accuracy and 17.58% in F1 score.

The outperformance of ResNet could be attributed to its deep architecture, which captures complex features and patterns in data very well, with a gain from transfer learning. It has a big number of layers, with pre-trained parameters on a large, diverse dataset, making it capable for fine-tuning and really beneficial for tasks other than simple classification.

Some of the benefits of using ResNet are faster convergence and learned weights that require fewer modifications to fit new tasks, hence better accuracy and generalization. Hence, ResNet becomes very useful in complex datasets where performance is driven by capturing intricate patterns with high accuracy and generalization. Using such a sophisticated model as ResNet really multiplies the benefits given to achieving better model predictions and, therefore, improving the reliability in practical use.
